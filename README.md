- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jeykobz
- 👀 I'm interested in computer science in general, but especially in artificial learning, machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of reinforcement learning and I'm currently developing a lightweight neural network analyzer based on PyTorch. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AL, ML, DL and RL related projects.
